    <p>
        I am Rishit Pandit and I've been working with computers and electronics for the best part of the last 7 years. I got into game programming in late 2019 when I stumbled upon Unreal Engine and later in early 2020 I realized that EGS wasn't just for downloading Unreal Engine but also came with 2 free games every week, and ever since then I have been involved in playing games, trying to analyze them, learning different techniques of tech implementations, environment art, level design and logical systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started my journey by following tutorials and remaking abilities and features from popular games like shooting, looting, building from Fortnite; spawning blueprints, harvesting resources, inventory management from Minecraft; AI patrols, AI detection, and Level Design from HITMAN and few others.
    </p>
    <p>
      I graduated high school in April, 2025 and I have joined National Institite of Technology, Jamshedpur for Bachelors of Technology in Mechanical Engineering. I also work on other projects in my free time ranging from Mechanics and Electronics to Web Development and Computer Architectures.

        <h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">First Completed Game</h3>
        <p class="text-light">
          I started with just blueprints, only implementing features and not making any complete games (due to overscoping) but then I managed to complete a game by making it as simple as possible in late 2023. I started working on this game to take part in a game jam and that is how I kept the scope in control and actually completed the game, but missed the jam due to an exam. I had applied a lot of the basic concepts in this game that I had learned in the past years.
          What I learned from this project:
          <ul>
            <li>Main Menu and Pause Menu</li>
            <li>Lots of debugging</li>
            <li>Adding Music and Effects</li>
            <li>Packaging and Testing</li>
          </ul>
          I also realized the limitations of Blueprints and hence started to learn C++ in late 2023 and since late 2024 I have been implementing most of my UE logic in C++ and I have also gotten comfortable with multiplayer logic and Replication in UE.

          <h2 class="mb-4 text-info">Previous Experience</h2>
          <p>
            Last year I volunteered in a group of developers trying on remaking an old game in UE5, an MMOFPS with an RTS, where the other members were from different countries all working in their spare time. I joined them to get some experience working in a team and with senior devs. Initially I worked on the website for the team, and then moved on to other responsibilities including: 
            <ul>
              <li>Main Menu and Settings</li>
              <li>Pre-Match Inventory Selection</li>
              <li>Player Data Storage</li>
            </ul>
              <p><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/qJGI-DdCyfY">link to the demo video</a></p>
              But as time went on, the team started to loose members due to time crunches in their personal lives so there wasn't much of a clear path to move in, so I started to work on some non-core parts of the game, mostly working on the RTS side of it. I started by learning some 3D modelling and mesh properties, then I made a map with clickable regions and connected it to a custom API with a custom plugin.<a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/oCULzYQm0cg">link to the demo video</a><br>
              By mid 2025 the group had been reduced to a 3D modeller, the original founder of the group and myself to complete the WWII MMOFPS. Seeing the Herculean task at hand and some free time after exams I challenged myself and with the help of a plugin created a functional multiplayer game base which covered all the stages of the game:
            <ul>
              <li>Match Pre-Start and Match-Start</li>
              <li>Spawn Point Selection</li>
              <li>Inventory Data Retrieval from cloud</li>
              <li>Team-Based Objective Capturing</li>
              <li>Game Timer and XP Gain System</li>
              <li>Gun Play and Respawn (from the plugin)</li>
              <li>Match End Conditions</li>
              <li>Match Post-End and Return to Lobby</li>
            </ul>
              But ever since joining University the momentum has worn out and having no senior dev to support the programming side has stalled progress. Since the past 2 months I have been able to implement Player Stats Tracking and Team Resources Tracking.

      <p class="text-justify">
        Currently I have started learning more about the underlying frameworks of Unreal Engine and about other supporting frameworks like the Gameplay Ability System. I have started by reading the documentation from Github and going through the example code. My next steps will be to make a complete game with a few good abilites and package it. I have also been picking up on the news about the current gaming scene, especially about the shooter games as I am a part of it, and I have been finding ways to make games more enjoyable and approachable. Some of the key areas are rampant cheating in games, optimization issues, communitation in team-based games, etc. I am also trying to find ways to solve or reduce the magnitude of these issues with other non-conventional methods that have not been tried yet.
