    <h2 class="mb-4 text-info">About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am Rishit Pandit and I've been working with computers and electronics for the best part of the last 7 years. I got into game programming in late 2019 when I stumbled upon Unreal Engine and later in early 2020 I realized that EGS wasn't just for downloading Unreal Engine but also came with 2 free games every week, and ever since then I have been involved in playing games, trying to analyze them, learning different techniques of tech implementations, environment art, level design and logical systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started my journey by following tutorials and remaking abilities and features from popular games like shooting, looting, building from Fortnite; spawning blueprints, harvesting resources, inventory management from Minecraft; AI patrols, AI detection, and Level Design from HITMAN and few others.
    </p>
    <p>
      I graduated high school in April, 2025 and I have joined the National Institute of Technology, Jamshedpur for Bachelors of Technology in Mechanical Engineering. I also work on other projects in my free time ranging from Mechanics and Electronics to Web Development and Computer Architectures.

        <h3 class="fw-bold mb-3">First Completed Game</h3>
        <p>
          I started by implementing features in blueprints but couldn't complete any game (due to scope creep) but then I learned my lesson and managed to complete a game by making it as simple as possible in late 2023. I started working on this game to take part in a game jam and that is how I kept the scope in control and actually completed the game, but missed the jam due to an exam. I applied a lot of the basic concepts in this game that I had learned in the past years.
          What I learned from this project:
          <ul>
            <li>Main Menu and Pause Menu</li>
            <li>Lots of debugging</li>
            <li>Adding Music and Effects</li>
            <li>Packaging and Testing</li>
          </ul>
          I also realized the limitations of Blueprints and hence started to learn C++ in late 2023 and since late 2024 I have been implementing most of my UE logic in C++ and I have also gotten comfortable with multiplayer logic and replication in UE.

          <h2 class="mb-4 text-info">Previous Experience</h2>
          <p>
            Last year I joined a volunteer group of developers trying on remaking an old game in UE5, an MMOFPS with an RTS, where the other members were from different countries all working in their spare time. I joined them out of our shared love for the game and to get some experience working in a team and with senior devs. Initially I worked on the website for the team, and then moved on to other responsibilities including: 
            <ul>
              <li>Main Menu and Settings</li>
              <li>Pre-Match Inventory Selection</li>
              <li>Player Data Storage</li>
            </ul>
              <p><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/qJGI-DdCyfY">link to the demo video</a></p>
              But as time went on, the team started to loose members due to time crunches in their personal lives so there wasn't much of a clear path to move in. I started to work on some non-core parts of the game, mostly working on the RTS side of it, to not stir-up the old code a lot. I started by learning some 3D modelling and mesh properties, then I made a map with clickable regions and connected it to a custom API with a custom plugin, I was trying to make it like the provinces and troops in EUIV.<a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/oCULzYQm0cg">link to the demo video</a><br>
            </p>
            <p>
              By mid 2025 the group had been reduced to a 3D modeller, the original founder of the group, a Flutter dev for the RTS, and myself to complete the WWII MMOFPS. Seeing the Herculean task at hand and some free time after exams I challenged myself and with the help of a plugin created a functional multiplayer base game which covered all the stages of the game:<br>
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Servers and Joining Matches</li>
              <li>Match Pre-Start and Match Start</li>
              <li>Spawn Point Selection</li>
              <li>Inventory Data Retrieval from cloud</li>
              <li>Team-Based Objective Capturing</li>
              <li>Game Timer and XP Gain System</li>
              <li>Gun Play and Respawn (from the plugin)</li>
              <li>Match End Conditions</li>
              <li>Match Post-End and Return to Lobby</li>
            </ul>
              Even before me joining University the team's momentum had been wearing out, and having no senior dev supporting the programming side had stalled progress. Since the past 2 months I have been able to implement Player Stats Tracking and Team Resources Tracking. Learned a lot from the team while we were together <3

      <p class="text-justify" style="color: #ddd;">
        Currently I have started learning more about the underlying frameworks of Unreal Engine and about other Epic Plugins like the Gameplay Ability System. I have started by reading the documentation from Github and going through the example code. My next steps will be to make a complete game with a few good abilites and package it. I have also been picking up on the news about the current gaming scene, especially about shooter games as I am a part of that, and I have been finding ways to make games more enjoyable and approachable. Some key areas are communitation issues in team-based games, rampant cheating, etc. What I am trying to do is find ways to solve or reduce the magnitude of these issues with other non-conventional methods that have not been tried yet.
